/*
    Google docs act weirdly - when you type into the doc, you're actually typing into an external iframe - and that iframe loads asynchronously ðŸ˜¤
    I have no idea why they would do something so evil but hey, this is a workaround.

    Also casual observation: Manifest v2 loads content scripts AFTER everything is loaded (including external iframes). Manifest v3 doesn't.
